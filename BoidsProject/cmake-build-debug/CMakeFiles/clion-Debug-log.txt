CMake Error at /Users/acciafranci/Documents/AI UNIFI/PARALLEL PROGRAMMING/SFML-3.0.0/lib/cmake/SFML/SFMLGraphicsSharedTargets.cmake:85 (message):
  The imported target "SFML::Graphics" references the file

     "/Users/acciafranci/Documents/AI UNIFI/PARALLEL PROGRAMMING/SFML-3.0.0/lib/libsfml-graphics.3.0.0.dylib"

  but this file does not exist.  Possible reasons include:

  * The file was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.

  * An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.

  * The installation package was faulty and contained

     "/Users/acciafranci/Documents/AI UNIFI/PARALLEL PROGRAMMING/SFML-3.0.0/lib/cmake/SFML/SFMLGraphicsSharedTargets.cmake"

  but not all the files it references.
